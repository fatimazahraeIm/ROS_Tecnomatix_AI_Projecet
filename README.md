# Autonomous Decision System for Optimizing Vehicle Routes in Tecnomatix Plant Simulation

## Project Description

This project involves developing an autonomous decision system to optimize the routes of vehicles in a Tecnomatix Plant Simulation model. The system leverages reinforcement learning algorithms, including Q-Learning, Sarsa, and Deep Q-Network (DQN), to train agents that can make optimal decisions based on the state of the simulation. The primary objective is to automate the simulation in Tecnomatix, enabling efficient and effective route optimization for vehicles within the simulation environment.

## Project Functionality

The project is designed to automate and control Tecnomatix Plant Simulation, which exists in a Windows environment, from a Linux environment using Docker. An intermediate server facilitates communication between the two environments, allowing for seamless integration and automation. The project includes training AI models using reinforcement learning algorithms and then applying these models to optimize vehicle routes in the simulation.

## Methods of optimization

### Method 1: Q-Learning

Method 1 implements the Q-Learning algorithm to optimize vehicle routes in the Tecnomatix Plant Simulation. The Q-Learning algorithm updates the Q-values based on the rewards received from the environment, allowing the agent to learn the optimal policy over time.

### Method 2: Sarsa

Method 2 implements the Sarsa algorithm, which is an on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm. Sarsa updates the Q-values based on the action taken and the subsequent action chosen by the policy, allowing the agent to learn the optimal policy while following the current policy.

### Method 3: AI Model training

Method 3 is based on training a Deep Q-Network (DQN) model to optimize vehicle routes in the Tecnomatix Plant Simulation. The model is trained using reinforcement learning algorithms, and the trained model is then applied to make optimal decisions in the simulation. Below is an image illustrating the reward and loss after training the model: ![Resultat d'entrainement](./plot_results.png)
